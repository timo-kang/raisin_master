## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements.

### Supported Operating Systems
* **Windows**: 10 / 11
* **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 (x86_64, ARM64)

### Dependencies

#### For Windows
You will need to manually install the following software. Please ensure that the executables for **Git**, **Git CLI**, and **Ninja** are available in your system's `Path` environment variable.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or newer)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [Git CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases)
* [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (with the "Desktop development with C++" workload)

Once the above dependencies are installed, complete the following steps in your terminal:

**Initialize Git Submodules:** This project uses `vcpkg` as a git submodule for C++ package management.
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init
    ```

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to configure and build your project.

### 1. Install RAISIN CLI and System Dependencies

Run the install command to set up the RAISIN command-line tool. This:
- Creates a Python virtual environment
- Installs system dependencies (Python, CMake, Ninja, clang-format, pre-commit, gh)
- Adds a shell function for auto-activation

```bash
./raisin --install
```

After installation, **restart your terminal** (or run `source ~/.bashrc`) to enable the `raisin` command.

> **Note:** The installer will prompt for sudo to install system dependencies. If you prefer to install them separately, you can run `sudo bash install_system_deps.sh` manually.

### 2. Project Configuration

Create your local configuration file by copying the provided example.
```bash
cp configuration_setting_example.yaml configuration_setting.yaml
```
Next, open **`configuration_setting.yaml`** and edit the following fields:
* **`gh_tokens`**: (Optional) GitHub Personal Access Token for each organization (e.g., `"raionrobotics": "ghp_your_token"`). Only needed for GitHub fallback or publishing to GitHub.
* **`user_type`**: Set to `"user"` for stable releases or `"devel"` for development builds.
* **`robot.api_key`**: (Optional) Robot API key for robot-authenticated OTA downloads. Prefer `RAISIN_ROBOT_API_KEY` for deployments.
* **`robot.node`**: (Required when using a robot API key) Robot-local node key registered on the OTA server, e.g. `"jetson"` or `"primary"`.
* **`packages_to_ignore`**: (Optional) List of packages to exclude from the build process.
* **`repos_to_ignore`**: (Optional) List of repositories to exclude (uses prebuilt binaries instead).

### 3. OTA Server Configuration

RAISIN downloads packages from the OTA (Over-The-Air) server by default, with GitHub releases as fallback. The default endpoint is `https://raisin-ota-api.raionrobotics.com/api`.

```bash
# (Optional) Override the default OTA endpoint
export RAISIN_OTA_ENDPOINT="https://your-custom-ota-server.com/api"

# (Optional) Specify SSH key path for authentication
export RAISIN_SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/my_key"

# (Optional) Custom archive name prefix (default: raisin-robot)
export RAISIN_ARCHIVE_NAME="raisin-robot"

# (Optional) Robot-authenticated OTA downloads and snapshot reporting
export RAISIN_ROBOT_API_KEY="rk_..."  # pragma: allowlist secret
export RAISIN_ROBOT_NODE="jetson"
```

#### SSH Key Authentication

OTA authentication uses SSH key-based challenge-response. The following key types are supported:
- **Ed25519** (`id_ed25519`) - Recommended
- **ECDSA** (`id_ecdsa`) - nistp256, nistp384, nistp521 curves
- **RSA** (`id_rsa`)

If `RAISIN_SSH_KEY` is not set, RAISIN auto-detects existing keys in `~/.ssh/` in the order above.

> **Note:** Ensure your SSH public key is registered with the OTA server before using OTA features.

#### Robot API Key Authentication

A robot registered on the OTA server can be issued an API key (`rk_<uuid>_<secret>`). When both `RAISIN_ROBOT_API_KEY` and `RAISIN_ROBOT_NODE` are set — or `robot.api_key` and `robot.node` in `configuration_setting.yaml` — the install flow additionally:

- downloads package blobs through the robot-authenticated endpoint, so downloads are attributed to this robot and node;
- verifies each download against the server's `X-Content-Hash` and aborts on a mismatch;
- asks the server for this node's **desired state**, honouring an assigned archive target and stopping the install entirely when a halt is in effect;
- reports an installed-software snapshot after the install so the fleet view reflects what the robot is actually running.

An archive name or version passed explicitly (`--archive-version`, `RAISIN_ARCHIVE_NAME`) is treated as a deliberate pin and takes precedence over the server's desired state.

> **Limitation:** enumerating an archive's packages still requires SSH authentication — the robot-authenticated API exposes no manifest listing for manifest-only archives. A robot provisioned with *only* an API key cannot yet resolve an archive, and will fall back to GitHub releases. Register an SSH key alongside the API key until the server adds a robot-facing manifest endpoint.

The key is read in this order: `RAISIN_ROBOT_API_KEY`, `RAISIN_ROBOT_API_KEY_FILE`, `configuration_setting.yaml`/`secrets.yaml`, then `~/.config/raisin/robot-api-key`. File-backed keys are ignored on POSIX systems unless they are `chmod 600`.

### 4. Add Source Packages

Create a directory named `src` in the root of the repository. Clone any source code packages you are developing or contributing to inside this `src` directory.
```bash
mkdir src
cd src
git clone <your-package-repository>
```

### 5. Install Release Packages

Run the `install` command to download packages from the OTA server (primary) or GitHub releases (fallback).

```bash
# Install from the tagged archive (default tag is derived from
# configuration_setting.yaml's user_type: 'devel' → 'latest',
# anything else → 'stable')
raisin install

# Install a specific package
raisin install raisin_network

# Install with specific version
raisin install raisin_network==1.1.0

# Install debug version
raisin install raisin_network --type debug

# Install both debug and release
raisin install raisin_network --all

# Install multiple packages
raisin install package1 package2 package3
```

#### Advanced Install Options

```bash
# Install from a specific archive version (overrides --tag)
raisin install --archive-version v2024.01

# Install from the archive tagged with a different name
raisin install --tag beta            # opt into a non-stable tag
raisin install --tag rollback        # roll back to a previously-promoted archive

# Fall back to the legacy latest-by-time selection (no tag required)
raisin install --tag none

# Install from a specific archive name
raisin install --archive-name team-robot

# Install packages at a specific timestamp (time-travel)
raisin install --at 2024-01-15
raisin install --at 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z

# Skip OTA and download directly from GitHub (for debugging)
raisin install --from-github

# Combine options
raisin install raisin_network --type debug --archive-name team-robot --archive-version v2024.01
```

> **Note:** Packages are downloaded from the OTA server by default. Use `--archive-name` to override `RAISIN_ARCHIVE_NAME` for a single install command. For debug installs, `-debug` is added only when the provided archive name does not already end with `-debug`. Use `--from-github` to bypass OTA and download directly from GitHub releases (useful for debugging or when OTA is unavailable).
>
> **Tag selection:** By default `raisin install` resolves the archive through a tag derived from `configuration_setting.yaml`:
> - `user_type: devel` → defaults to **`latest`** (newest archive available, including pre-releases)
> - anything else (e.g. `user_type: user`) → defaults to **`stable`** (the promoted/blessed archive)
>
> **Fallback chain** when the requested tag is missing on OTA (or the server is unreachable):
> 1. Try the requested tag (e.g. `latest`).
> 2. Fall back to **`stable`** on OTA — so a devel user lands on the blessed archive when `latest` hasn't been promoted yet, instead of skipping straight to GitHub.
> 3. Fall back to GitHub releases for each configured repository.
>
> Each step prints a clear warning so operators can spot misconfigured tags in logs. Pass `--tag <name>` to override (e.g. `beta`), or `--tag none` to skip the tag and use the legacy latest-by-time selection on OTA.

### 6. Install Package Dependencies

Run the package dependency installer to install package-specific dependencies (e.g., vcpkg packages, ROS packages, custom libraries).
```bash
sudo bash install_dependencies.sh
```

> **Note:** This script runs `install_dependencies.sh` files directly from source packages (`src/`) and release packages (`release/install/`).

### 7. Setup and Generate Build Files

Run the `setup` command to configure the CMake environment and generate interface files.
```bash
# Setup all packages
raisin setup

# Setup specific packages
raisin setup raisin_network
```

### 8. Build the Project

Use the `build` command to compile the project. You must specify the build type using `--type` (or `-t`).

```bash
# Build release version
raisin build --type release

# Build debug version
raisin build --type debug

# Build and install artifacts
raisin build --type release --install

# Short form
raisin build -t release -i

# Build specific target
raisin build -t release raisin_network
```

Alternatively, advanced users can use standard CMake commands in the `cmake-build-debug/` or `cmake-build-release/` directories.

#### Using raisin Python Packages (e.g. `raisin_network_py`)

Pass `--raisin-py-exec` to target a specific Python interpreter when building Python extension modules:

```bash
# Build and install — uses the raisin venv Python by default (~/.venvs/raisin_master/bin/python3)
raisin build -t release --install

# Target a specific Python interpreter (e.g. your own virtualenv)
raisin build -t release --install --raisin-py-exec /path/to/myvenv/bin/python3
```

When `--install` is used, a `raisin.pth` file is automatically written to the target Python's `site-packages` directory. This makes raisin Python packages (such as `raisin_network_py`) importable without setting `PYTHONPATH`:

### 9. Additional Commands

#### Publish a Release
Build, package, and upload a release to GitHub or OTA server:
```bash
# Publish to GitHub (default)
raisin publish raisin_network

# Publish only release build
raisin publish raisin_network --type release

# Publish only debug build
raisin publish raisin_network --type debug

# Publish to OTA server instead of GitHub
raisin publish raisin_network --upload-ota

# Dry run without uploading
raisin publish raisin_network --dry-run
```

> **Note:** Use `--upload-ota` to upload to the OTA server instead of GitHub. This requires `RAISIN_OTA_ENDPOINT` to be set.

#### Cross-Architecture Build Support

RAISIN uses portable CPU architecture flags by default on Linux so generated and published binaries work across different machines within the same architecture family.

**Default targets:**
| Architecture | Default `-march` | Compatible Targets |
|---|---|---|
| x86_64 | `x86-64-v3` | Intel (Haswell+), AMD (Zen 2+), Steam Deck |
| ARM64 | `armv8.2-a+crypto+fp16+dotprod` | Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson Orin AGX/NX |

**Override the default with the `RAISIN_MARCH` environment variable:**
```bash
# Use a specific architecture
RAISIN_MARCH=znver2 raisin build -t release
RAISIN_MARCH=znver2 raisin publish my_package -t release

# Use native for machine-specific local builds
RAISIN_MARCH=native raisin setup
RAISIN_MARCH=native raisin build -t release
RAISIN_MARCH=native raisin publish my_package -t release
```

This default applies to `raisin setup`, `raisin build`, `raisin build --install`, and `raisin publish` unless `RAISIN_MARCH` is set explicitly.

> **Warning:** Do not mix packages published with different `-march` flags on the same target machine. While the ABI is compatible, individual binaries may contain instructions unsupported by the target CPU, causing "Illegal instruction" crashes at runtime.

#### Architecture-Conditional CMake Args (release.yaml)

Third-party packages that need different CMake arguments per architecture can use the `cmake_args` field in `release.yaml`:

```yaml
pure_cmake:
  - name: depthai-core
    cmake_args:
      aarch64: [-DDEPTHAI_BOOTSTRAP_VCPKG=OFF]
```

Keys under `cmake_args` are matched against `platform.machine()` (e.g., `x86_64`, `aarch64`). Omitted architectures receive no extra flags.

#### List Packages
View available packages:
```bash
# List local packages
raisin index local

# List all remote packages on GitHub
raisin index release

# List versions of a specific package
raisin index release raisin_network
```

#### Git Operations
Manage multiple repositories:
```bash
# Show status of all repositories
raisin git status

# Pull all repositories
raisin git pull

# Pull from specific remote
raisin git pull --remote upstream

# Fetch from a remote for all src repositories (default: origin)
raisin git fetch --remote origin

# Checkout or create a branch across all repositories in src
raisin git checkout --branch feature-branch

# Delete a local branch across all repositories in src (use -f to force)
raisin git delete-branch --branch old-feature
raisin git delete-branch -b old-feature -f

# List local branches for all repositories in src
raisin git list-branches

# Push the current branch to the same branch name on a remote for all src repositories
raisin git push-current --remote origin

# Setup git remotes
raisin git setup origin:raionrobotics dev:yourusername
```

#### Get Help
View help for any command:
```bash
# Main help
raisin --help
raisin -h

# Command-specific help
raisin build --help
raisin publish -h
```

> **Note:** If you have multiple RAISIN repo clones, `raisin` prefers the clone that contains your current working directory (walks up to find `raisin.py`). You can also use `python3 raisin.py` directly if needed.
