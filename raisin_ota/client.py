"""
OTA client for RAISIN.

Handles all interactions with the raisin-ota-server:
- SSH challenge-response authentication (no passwords)
- Package upload (used by publish command)
- Package download (used by install command)

Uses DEFAULT_OTA_ENDPOINT by default. Override with RAISIN_OTA_ENDPOINT env var.
All operations fail gracefully — OTA is supplementary, never blocks existing flows.

            actually there.

            Default True because taking the report away from a caller with no
            later moment is worse than sending it early to one that has.
