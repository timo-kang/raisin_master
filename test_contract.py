"""What this client assumes about the OTA server, asserted against a running one.

Unit tests cannot catch contract drift: the mocks encode the contract as this
client believes it to be, so a server that changes its mind keeps them green.
Every contract break found so far — a blob upload the endpoint never accepted,
`GET /packages` answering 400 to a parameter that was reported as "not found",
a manifest route that validated nothing — was found by making a real request
and would have been caught here.

Run against a server:

    RAISIN_OTA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8001/api python -m unittest test_contract

Skips entirely when no server is reachable, so it is safe in CI and on a
developer machine without one.

## What this suite may and may not assert

This repository is public. The suite is *designed* to document server
behaviour, which makes it the most likely place for an operational detail to
leak by convenience rather than by decision.

The rule: **assert what is allowed or refused, never how much or how often.**

- "`GET /packages` rejects `name`" — a contract. Fine.
- "manifest routes are closed to a robot credential" — a restriction, and
  publishing it says the guard exists rather than where it is missing. Fine.
- "the machine bucket allows N requests per M seconds" — an operational
  number, and knowing it exactly is what makes a budget cheap to exhaust.
  Belongs to the private side.

`TestThisSuiteKeepsItsOwnRule` enforces it on the assertions here, because a
convention nothing checks is a convention that erodes.

## Nothing here writes

Two rules keep it that way, and they are also what makes it a good contract
test rather than a smoke test:

1. Reads assert the **shape this client parses** — not the whole response, only
   the fields whose absence would break something here.
2. Writes are asserted by **how the endpoint refuses**. Sending a deliberately
   incomplete body and checking that the rejection names the missing field
   tests the contract precisely, creates nothing, and is exactly the class of
   bug that broke publish three times over.
